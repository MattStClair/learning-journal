In terms of technical stuff, I still have a lot to learn about the terminal but I am learning, as well as trying to remember certain things I have learned in the pass to apply. For example, I am learning the hierarchy and trying to pay more attention to that. Some commands I know: cd, ls, and pwd. I think that is the most difficult part, balancing the feeling of learning and knowing very little with the feeling that I do know some stuff.

Another thing I learned from today is I got more comfortable with github and navigating the web gui.

Lastly, even while typing this I am uncertain about how I am going to add, commit, and push this assignment haha. So I guess the terminal is the beast, which I should have been practicing while doing the project as the directions said, so far but I have learned some stuff which I dont want to forget.

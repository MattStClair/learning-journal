Yesterday was a tough one but today went pretty well. I think the nice thing about today is that I
felt the benefits of all of the struggling I did yesterday from learning loops. Also, peer programming
 is pretty sweet, sometimes it can feel pretty lonely being just you and a problem and it is really useful
 top kick ideas around and organize information outside of your own head.

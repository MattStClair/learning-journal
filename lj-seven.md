#journal class ten

Today, I finally finished getting the salmon cookies project functionality
in order. Again, really getting the hang of loops and the way that you can
put a method outside of the loop to occur once, then let the loop happen, and just how
the order of things can be very pivotal.
This will be a big css html weekend but I am looking forward to trying some different css
stuff. It is my goal to rather than just monkey around wit the functionality, move things around
after reading about them.

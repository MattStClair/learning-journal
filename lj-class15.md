The git hub exercise really helped me gain a more clear understanding of merge conflicts and the
way they look from multiple git accounts. I took my exam too and got a 76% which is not the best but
it is passing. I feel like their are still java script concepts that have not stuck and
in some ways I feel like there is no way in just three weeks that I could understand them
all well enough to get above a 90 on that test.

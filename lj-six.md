I can branch in git hub pretty comfortably and have most of salmon cookies done. The challenging part of
these labs as with most of them is that you are trying to learn many concepts all at once. For example, trying to
use create tables, getElements by ids and develop constructors all at once while learning them all at once
was pretty confusing but after banging my head against the ideas for a while, I am pretty good at for loops.
